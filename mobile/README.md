# My part of implementation

Main parts that i have implemented:

- Simplified account login
- Navigation
- Finance page
- Profile page

# Navigation
I used `@react-navigation` library to implement navigation in our application. Navigation allows you to switch between the following pages: home, tasks, events, finance and profile.
